# Node Editor IA

## Installation

We currently have issues with the yml file, but the following instructions should work on a well configurated *bash*/*cmd* with a regular *Anaconda* installation:

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda update -n base --all
    conda crate -n IANode python=3.7
    conda activate IANode
    conda install pyqt
    conda install tensorflow

## Use

Run `main.py`
